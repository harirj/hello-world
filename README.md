My First Repository

I have learned OOP (Python, JScript, VB) in the past.
I do not remember how to do much of the coding syntax, but I do remember the structure of programing.
Now, I am a SysAdmin in a combined Windows and Linux environment.
Seeing that Powershell is very user-friendly and available on both platforms, I am beginming my journey of learning Powershell.
